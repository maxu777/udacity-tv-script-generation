# Generate TV Scripts (using Recurrent Neural Network)
Udacity Deep Learning nanodegree project: `TV Script generation`

## Introduction
In this project, you'll generate your own [Seinfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld) TV scripts using RNNs. You'll be using a [Seinfeld dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/thec03u5/seinfeld-chronicles#scripts.csv) of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new, "fake" TV script.

`git clone https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch.git`

This way you can stay up to date with any changes we make by pulling the changes to your local repository with git pull.

## Example of the script generated with this network:

> jerry:, and they had to reduce the defendants.
> 
> vandelay: you have a pee bystander? you want to get together?
> 
> jerry: i don't know what to get.
> 
> [new witness: marcellino in the autumn room, but the bubble boy was in
> development, i have to get together.
> 
> [new witness: marcellino? you banks the defendants, and i was employed
> nyhart.
> 
> hoyt: you are the defendants.
> 
> hoyt: so, you have a good time to get a call?
> 
> george: no further vogel.
> 
> george: so, i don't think so.
> 
> jerry: well, i think they were robbed, you can do it for a private

> 
> hoyt: so i don't recall you know, and i could get the whole time in
> the bubble?
> 
> [new witness: moors.
> 
> hoyt: so, what did you have to say?
> 
> jerry: yes, yeah?
> 
> george: oh, yeah!
> 
> hoyt: i don't know if i was a little anxious in latham school
> delinquent.
> 
> [new witness: moops
> 
> elaine: moops!
> 
> jerry: what?
> 
> elaine: i know what you want. i mean, you know, i was thinking about
> the meals of that courtroom.
> 
> chiles: so, what did i say?
> 
> jerry: i can't believe that.
> 
> hoyt: so you want to get to argentina?
> 
> hoyt: i was a little incriminating of bystanding.
> 
> hoyt: so, what is this?
> 
> hoyt: no, i don't know.
> 
> vandelay: well, the judge council robbing robbing that jury.
> 
> [new witness: the contest, jerry, it's a misprint.
> 
> hoyt: that's not fair.
> 
> hoyt: what is this?
> 
> jerry: i don't know.
> 
> hoyt: you want a marble rye?
> 
> hoyt: no further questions, geraldo. i think i was employed to reduce
> you.
> 
> hoyt: so, what's going on there?
> 
> elaine: i don't want to smother him.
